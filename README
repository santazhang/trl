How to build
============

TRL depends on 3 other projects:

  * https://github.com/santazhang/base-utils
  * https://github.com/santazhang/simple-rpc
  * https://github.com/santazhang/memdb

Checkout those 2 projects, make sure you have following directory layout:

    $WORKSPACE/base-utils
    $WORKSPACE/simple-rpc
    $WORKSPACE/memdb
    $WORKSPACE/trl

Build and test base-utils, simple-rpc and memdb first:

    cd $WORKSPACE/base-utils
    ./waf configure
    ./waf
    ./build/unittest
    cd $WORKSPACE/simple-rpc
    ./waf configure
    ./waf
    ./build/unittest
    cd $WORKSPACE/memdb
    ./waf configure
    ./waf
    ./build/unittest

Now you are ready to build TRL:

    ./waf configure
    ./waf


How to setup
============

The system should run on an NFS volume, so that all components share storage.

First, properly configure the system:

    * List of server nodes in conf/config.ini
        + Number of servers should match webdemo/public/index.html (search for "noUiSlider")
    * Update the server address in webdemo/launch-clients.sh (RLOG_SERVER=...)

Then, start all the components:

    * Login to all the server nodes listed in conf/config.ini, boot the servers
        + ./bin/trl_server <server-id> (server-id starts from 0)
    * Start statistics server (on RLOG_SERVER)
        + On the webdemo server, run ./stat-logger.rb
    * Login to all client nodes, boot all clients
        + Example command: ./launch-clients.sh 1 3 50
            - 1: first client node
            - 3: a total of 3 client nodes
            - 50: largest client process id (as in webdemo/public/index.html)
    * Start webdemo server (on RLOG_SERVER)
        + ruby ./application.rb -o RLOG_SERVER -p 8080

Now just browse to RLOG_SERVER:8080, you should see the demo running.
